# Gifts?

We have received requests about wedding showers and gift registries, and are very thankful that our friends and families are so thoughtful.

This summer, we will be moving together to San Francisco from Indianapolis. We are trying to minimize the amount of things we take across the country. As such, we would like to avoid having to move lots of fantastic gifts or putting them into medium-term storage.

Also, we have been on our own for a little while, so we feel that we may already have many of the things that a newly married couple might need.

For these reasons, we would like to avoid wedding showers and boxed gifts at the wedding.
