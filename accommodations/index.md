# Accommodations

For our guests coming from out of town, we have some information on places to stay during your visit to Indianapolis.

## Places to stay in Indy

For all of the places to stay, we have made reservations but fortunately are under no obligation to fill the rooms we reserved. However, if they are not taken by the end date of the reservation, other people may take the rooms and the group rate will no longer apply. We have personally looked at the hotels and think they will be good places to stay, with competitive rates.

Taxis to and from the IMA from most hotels would be about $15 to $20 each way.

### The Omni - Downtown

Our number one recommendation is [The Omni Severin Hotel][omni] ([map](http://goo.gl/maps/CY7Xs)), located in the center of downtown Indianapolis, attached to Circle Center Mall.

This is an elegant 4+ star rated hotel located within walking distance to many restaurants and retail stores. This is the best deal Monica found for a downtown location. It's about a 15 minute drive to the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) by highway ([map](http://goo.gl/maps/pm5Eq)) or a 16 minute drive through town ([map](http://goo.gl/maps/Nzbtg)).

The nightly rate is $129 for single double bed. It is $139/night for triple/quad. Valet parking is an additional $20 dollars per night. You can also choose to park in [mall parking](http://circlecentermall.com/parking.html) (as the mall is attached to the Omni.)

We have reserved 20 rooms for the Panozzo/Mazda wedding for Friday and 30 rooms for Saturday. Please [make your reservation][omni] by Sunday, March 19th to receive the group rate.

The address is 40 West Jackson Place, Indianapolis, Indiana 46225.

The phone number is (317) 634-6664, Fax: (317) 687-3612.

### Drury Hotels - Northwest

A second option is [Drury Hotels][drury] ([map](http://goo.gl/maps/3hbz8)), located on the northwest side of town (just as you're coming in on I-65 South from Chicago.) It is a good, standard hotel located in a commercial area. Retail stores, restaurants, and other activities are a tiny drive away. It's an easy 15 minute drive to the Indianapolis Museum of Art ([map](http://goo.gl/maps/GS0GY)).

The nightly rate is $89.95 for two double-bed rooms or single king bed rooms. There is no parking fee.

We have reserved 10 rooms for the Panozzo/Mazda wedding Friday and Saturday. Please [make your reservation][drury] by Monday, March 18th to receive your group discount.

The address is 9320 N Michigan Rd, Indianapolis, IN.

The phone number is (317) 876-9777.

### Staybridge Suites - Downtown

Staybridge Suites is located in downtown Indianapolis ([map](http://goo.gl/maps/6ers7)). This newer hotel is located almost directly next to the Lucas Oil Stadium in a remote, industrial area of downtown. You would need to drive to places if you needed anything. The hotel is about a 15 minute drive to the IMA by highway ([map](http://goo.gl/maps/F4emj)) or through downtown ([map](http://goo.gl/maps/Q5W4A)).

Studio queen suites are available for $94 dollars per room. There is a $14 self-parking fee.

We have reserved 15 rooms for Friday and Saturday. Please make your reservation by March 24th to receive the group discount. Reservations should be made by phone at (317) 536-7500 (say that you are with the Panozzo-Mazda wedding.) An alternate phone number is (877) 238-8889.

The address is 535 S. West Street, Indianapolis, IN 46225.

### Wingate - West Side

Wingate by Wyndham Rockville Road ([map](http://goo.gl/maps/kmVEK)) is a nice, basic, clean hotel with a pool and hot tub. Please check an online map like Google to see nearby amenities.

We have reserved 15 rooms for Friday and Saturday (14 rooms with 2 queen beds and 1 room handicap-accessible with 2 double beds) The rate is $84.15 plus tax, and up to 4 people can stay in the room for no additional charge. They will hold the block of rooms until April 6 at which time the rooms will be available to the public. Reservations can be canceled until 6 PM on the first day of arrival without charges.

To make reservations, call (317) 243-8310 and ask for the Panozzo/Mazda wedding rate.

The address is 5797 Rockville Road, Indianapolis, IN 46224

### Other options

#### North Michigan Road corridor hotels
You may also check into the numerous hotel chains along the North Michigan Road corridor between I-465 and 86th Street. We have not blocked rooms at these hotels, but you may be able to apply various discount programs (AARP, AAA, Military) to your hotel stay.

#### Alternatives
Other options that might be good include renting a home for the weekend if you have a large group of people coming. Check out [homeaway.com](homeaway.com) for some ideas. Those in the more adventurous mood might consider [airbnb.com](airbnb.com) as a place to score some alternative housing.
