# Accommodations

For our guests coming from out of town, we have some information on places to stay during your visit to Indianapolis.

## Places to stay in Indy

For all of the places to stay, we have made reservations but fortunately are under no obligation to fill the rooms we reserved. However, if they are not taken by the end date of the reservation, other people may take the rooms and the group rate will no longer apply. We have personally looked at the hotels and think they will be good places to stay, with competitive rates.

### Omni

Our most recommended option is [The Omni Severin Hotel][omni] ([map][omnimap]), located in the center of downtown Indianapolis, attached to Circle Center Mall.

It is a very classy hotel. This is the best deal Monica found downtown.

The nightly rate is $129 for single double bed. It is $139/night for triple/quad. Parking is an additional $20 dollars per night. You can also choose to park in [mall parking](http://circlecentermall.com/parking.html) (as the mall is attached to the Omni.)

We have reserved 20 rooms for Friday and 30 rooms for Saturday. Please [make your reservation][omni] by Sunday, March 19th to receive the group rate.

The address is 40 West Jackson Place, Indianapolis, Indiana 46225.

The phone number is (317) 634-6664, Fax: (317) 687-3612.

### Drury Hotels

A second option is [Drury Hotels][drury] ([map](http://goo.gl/maps/8oeoV)), located on the northwest side of town just inside of I-465. It is less elegant than The Omni, but should be a good place located in a safe area of town. It is very close to I-65 going to Chicago. It is about a twenty-five minute drive to downtown Indianapolis.

The nightly rate is $89.95 for two double-bed rooms or single king bed rooms. There is no parking fee.

We have reserved 10 rooms for Friday and Saturday. Please [make your reservation][drury] by Monday, March 18th to receive your group discount.

The address is 9320 N Michigan Rd, Indianapolis, IN.

The phone number is (317) 876-9777.

### Staybridge Suites Downtown

Staybridge Suites is located in downtown Indianapolis ([map](http://goo.gl/maps/S3x3g)). This hotel is walking distance from downtown, but is not in as appealing of a location as The Omni. It is located on the south side of Lucas Oil Stadium (almost directly behind it.)

Studio queen suites are available for $94 dollars per room. There is a $14 parking fee.

We have reserved 15 rooms for Friday and Saturday. Please make your reservation by March 24th to receive the group discount. Reservations should be made by phone at (317) 536-7500 (say that you are with the Panozzo-Mazda wedding.) An alternate phone number is (877) 238-8889.

The address is 535 S. West Street, Indianapolis, IN 46225.

### Other options

Other options that might be good include renting a home for the weekend if you have a large group of people coming. Check out [homeaway.com](homeaway.com) for some ideas. Those in the more adventurous mood might consider [airbnb.com](airbnb.com) as a place to score some alternative housing.
